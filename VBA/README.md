* [Stock Data](StockData_VBAScript_MuktaJ.vbs) - The script developed on test data was then applied to this larger dataset.

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

  * The total Volume of the stock

  * Ticker symbol

  * Have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

  * Locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

   
  * Make the appropriate adjustments to the script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
