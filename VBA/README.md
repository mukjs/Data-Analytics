# The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

Use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files

* [Test Data](alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Stock market analyst

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

  * The total Volume of the stock

  * Ticker symbol

  * Have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


  * Your solution will include everything from the moderate challenge.

  * Your solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

   
  * Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

### Other Considerations

* Used the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing the code. This dataset is smaller and allowed to test faster. The code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.The code was then applied to the larger dataset `Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx`
